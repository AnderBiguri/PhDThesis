This thesis describes the research done for the [TIGRE toolbox](https://github.com/CERN/TIGRE) and further.

If you are here because of the TIGRE toolbox, the most relevant stuff is on:

**Chapter 3**: Mathematics of the algorithms in TIGRE

**Chapter 4**: GPU implementation of tomographic operations in detail.

**Chapter 5**: Brief showcase/study of behaviour  of algorithms in TIGRE.

If you are here because if the Motion compensation code, you'd like to read

**Chapter 6**: General proposition of a GPU accelerated motion compensation algorithm

**Chapter 7**: Numerical study of the algorithm under controlled  conditions.

Topic: `X-ray tomography`, `CBCT`, `Iterative reconstruction`, `GPU computing`, `Motion compensation`.
