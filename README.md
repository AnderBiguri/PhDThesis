#Iterative Reconstruction and Motion compensation in Computed Tomography on GPUs

PhD Thesis by Ander Biguri, 2018.

University of Bath,

Thesis supervisors: Manucherh Soleimani, Steven Hancock, Manjit Dosanjh


This thesis describes the research done for the [TIGRE toolbox](https://github.com/CERN/TIGRE) and further.

If you are here because of the TIGRE toolbox, the most relevant stuff is on:

**Chapter 3**: Mathematics of the algorithms in TIGRE

**Chapter 4**: GPU implementation of tomographic operations in detail.

**Chapter 5**: Brief showcase/study of behavioru of algorithms in TIGRE.


Topic: `X-ray tomography`, `CBCT`, `Iterative recosntruction`, `GPU computing`, `Motion compensation`.
