  Abstract                 = {Abstract There are a number of powerful total variation (TV) regularization methods with&#13; great promises in limited data cone-beam CT reconstruction with an enhancement&#13; of image quality. These promising TV methods require careful selection of image&#13; reconstruction parameters for which there is no well established criteria. This pa-&#13; per presents a comprehensive valuation of parameter selection in a number of major&#13; TV-based reconstruction algorithms. The appropriate way of selecting the values for&#13; each individual parameter has been suggested. Finally, the new adaptive-weighted&#13; projection-controlled steepest descent (AwPCSD) algorithm is presented which imple-&#13; ments the edge-preserving function for CBCT reconstruction with limited data. The&#13; proposed algorithm shows signicant robustness compared to other three existing al-&#13; gorithms: ASD-POCS, AwASD-POCS and PCSD. The proposed AwPCSD algorithm&#13; is able to preserve the edges of the reconstructed images better with less sensitive pa-&#13; rameters to tune.},

  Abstract                 = {An iterative algorithm, based on recent work in compressive sensing, is developed for volume image reconstruction from a circular cone-beam scan. The algorithm minimizes the total variation (TV) of the image subject to the constraint that the estimated projection data is within a specified tolerance of the available data and that the values of the volume image are non-negative. The constraints are enforced by the use of projection onto convex sets (POCS) and the TV objective is minimized by steepest descent with an adaptive step-size. The algorithm is referred to as adaptive-steepest-descent-POCS (ASD-POCS). It appears to be robust against cone-beam artifacts, and may be particularly useful when the angular range is limited or when the angular sampling rate is low. The ASD-POCS algorithm is tested with the Defrise disk and jaw computerized phantoms. Some comparisons are performed with the POCS and expectation-maximization (EM) algorithms. Although the algorithm is presented in the context of circular cone-beam image reconstruction, it can also be applied to scanning geometries involving other x-ray source trajectories.},
