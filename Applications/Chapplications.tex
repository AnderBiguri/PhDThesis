\chapter{Experiments and applications}

In the previous two chapters the mathematical and computational challenges of image reconstruction for CT have been discussed. In chapter 3, a detailed description of a variety of different algorithms has been presented, including the ART family of algorithms, CGLS and a few TV approaches for smooth reconstruction, as well as the classic FDK reconstruction. Additionally in chapter 4, the computational aspect of CT is discussed, where the problems computing the exact adjoint of the projection operation and mainly the computational burden of some of the operations have been mentioned. Considering the variety of available methods and the specifics of the implementation of the software developed, the TIGRE Toolbox, experiments on how these algorithms compare and behave are due. Furthermore, the performance of these algorithms with different experimental datasets is also an important analysis.

This chapter shows experimental analysis on both of the topics. First a variety of convergence analyses with different algorithms using synthetic data is performed, showing the differences not only between algorithms, but also between option on parameter selections. The section tries to illustrate and perhaps help build intuition into all the different parameters and options that each of these algorithms has, both within the algorithms themselves and among the different ones. Additionally some highlights on the practical challenges that the use of the algorithms entail in real applications are given.

In the second section of this chapter, a few examples of some of the algorithms are shown in different CT applications, both cone and parallel beam. Data from various different applications, from medicine to science has been tested using the TIGRE toolbox. While quantitative analysis is not possible with these datasets because the truth is not known, some insight in how the algorithms behave in each case is discussed.

\section{Algorithm experiments}
This section explores a variety of algorithms and the parameters within them, and shows how they behave with different synthetic data in simulation studies. 

\subsection{Convergence rates}

In chapter 3 the convergence rates of the algorithms has been mentioned, as well as computational times. Different algorithms will reach different residuals at a given iteration and thus understanding which ones can converge faster and theoretically give a better result earlier is important. However, at the scale of the CBCT problem, faster no only means reaching a residual that is smaller in the same number of iterations, as the computational burden of each of the iterations also needs to be considered. And, as the backprojection operator is not exactly the adjoint of the projection operator, an effect that the classic formulation of these algorithms do not take into account can happen: divergence. All the algorithms (at least in this work) are mathematically designed to always reduce the residual each iteration, but that formulation relies on a correct adjoint operator. Thus, sometimes, when the algorithms in TIGRE find a solution very close to the minimum residual solution, they may diverge. The code in the toolbox does generally check for divergence and stop, but one of the effect that can be observed is that some algorithm will always diverge to yield a residual that is larger than others. This means that some algorithm can, regardless of their computational times, reach to a better solution than others.

All tests in this section are performed on the XCAT phantom\cite{XCAT}, in a $128^3$ voxel size and $256^2$ detector. A different number of angles are used, always uniformly distributed around a full circle. Figure \ref{fig:XCAT} shows cross sections of the phantom in its mid plane and figure \ref{fig:XCATproj} shows 3 projections of the phantom as simulated for the following tests.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Update ordering in SART}

An analysis of the different ART-type algorithms is presented in this section. One of the discussed parameters that has an effect in the convergence rate of the ART-type algorithms is the ordering of the projections used. Research has shown that in ART, the angle ordering can have an effect on the residual\cite{herman1993algebraic}\cite{zouzias2013randomized}, however in the algorithms feasible for big scale tomography, this effect is smaller. Figure \ref{fig:SARTanglesconv} shows the convergence of SART during 150 iterations using 100 projections as data. The same configuration of SART is run using ordered, randomly ordered and angular distance maximizing ordering schemes for the update order. While minor, the figure shows how random ordering does generally increases the convergence rate of the algorithm, at no computational cost. This is the default value in the software. Note that in this test there is no reduction of the relaxation parameter $\lambda$.

\caption[Nomralized residual vs iteration of SART vs projection update order]{\label{fig:SARTanglesconv} Normalized residual versus iteration of SART compared to different angle ordering schemes, using 100 projections and no relaxation parameter reduction} 
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Comparison between SART, OS-SART and SIRT}
These algorithms have very different convergence, as updating the image per-projection angle has the effect of converging faster (in iteration number). However, the computational times are greatly reduced by updating more rows at the same time. This effect can be seen in figure \ref{fig:SARTtypesconv}, where the convergence versus iteration of these three algorithms is plotted. Note the convergence difference between SART and SIRT, where SIRT doesn't reach SART's residual even after 1000 iterations, however, each iteration of SIRT is two orders of magnitude faster than SART. OS-SART provides a middle ground alternative. Due to the specifics of the acceleration procedures for backprojection, OS-SART speeds are closer to SIRT than to SART (i.e., the speed does not change linearly with the image updates per iteration), however it is more prone to divergent behaviour in TIGRE. In the figure, OS-SART stops converging after 48 iterations. Of course, this behaviour is very data-specific, and there are multiple cases where it does not diverge. Figure \ref{fig:SARTtypesconv} shows the result images of these three algorithms after 150 iterations (48 for OS-SART). Note that this example has limited data, so even in the best case, the images are slightly noisy.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Relaxation parameter}
The choice of a proper relaxation parameter significantly changes the speed which a solution is found, and can avoid infinitely iterating through the same hyperplanes in case of an under determined or noisy solution. In TIGRE, two methods are implemented, as described in chapter 2: multiplying the relaxation parameter by a reduction factor after each iteration, and the Nesterov accelerated update, that does not technically update the relaxation parameter, but updates the image at each iteration using an iteration specific combination ratio of the gradients of the current and previous iterations. It requires more memory as it needs one extra image-sized variable to store the previous update, but the the algorithm finds a solution considerably faster, as can be seen in figure \ref{fig:SARTlambda}. In the figure each of the SART, OS-SART and SIRT algorithms residuals is plotted, and in each of them three versions are displayed, no relaxation parameter update, reduction with $r_{red}=0.99$ and the Nesterov update. In the plot it can also be seen that reducing the relaxation parameter by a ratio, while a good approach in SART-based hybrid algorithms such as the TV minimizing ones in TIGRE, leads to slower residual reduction and ultimately to a worse image.

In figure \ref{fig:SARTlambdaplot}, the solution found by the three algorithms using reduction of the relaxation parameter, using a Nesterov update and using a static relaxation parameter of $\lambda=1$ can be seen side by side . The superior solution found by Nesterov is clear, and both SART and OS-SART reach a minimum in very few iterations. While SART does reach a better image (both in residual and error) without using Nesterov's update, the difference is minimal. It is important to note that using Nesterov's update, likely due to its fast convergence, leads to a faster divergent behaviour by the algorithms, thus the residual needs to be checked in each iteration leading to some computational overhead.

\subsection{Total variation minimization}
There are 4 total variation minimizing algorithms in TIGRE, with 2 different minimization functionals. As previously described, ASD-POCS, OS-ASD-POCS and B-ASD-POCS-$\beta$ minimize the TV using a POCS minimization technique by minimizing the data constraint and TV norm independently using gradient descent. SART-TV however uses the ROF model for the TV-minimization step. The total variation algorithms are designed for applications where the image is piecewise-smooth, as they will try to minimize the gradient, by creating single-valued regions in the image. In CT, the most noisy images are reconstructed when either the data is very noisy (generally due to small acquisition times and/or low energy X-rays) or when the data are limited, either due to limited angular range or more importantly a limited number of projections. 

An example of the behaviour of the TV algorithms with the same dataset as in figures \ref{fig:XCAT} and \ref{fig:XCATproj} is shown in figure \ref{fig:TVXCAT}. In this case, 30 uniformly sampled projections are used perturbed with Poisson and Gaussian noise to simulate photon scattering and electronic noise, respectively. The figure shows FDK and OS-SART reconstructions, and the 4 mentioned TV algorithms. It is clear that the TV algorithms do provide a smoother reconstruction, and with less normalized root mean squared error (NRMSE), as shown in table \ref{tab:NRMSE TVs}.
The reconstruction by FDk is plagued with noise. And, while the main structural features can be seen, most of the detail is lost. Even the bones themselves are practically indistinguishable from noise. OS-SART does reconstruct a smoother image as expected, as it minimizes the 2-norm and, while one can see more details in the image, it is still poor. The 4 TV algorithms can be seen to flatten out the attenuation levels to similar values, thus reducing most of the noise. Additionally most of the features get clearly separated from the attenuation levels of the surrounding tissues and some of the algorithms (such as ASD-POCS) are able to reconstruct even single pixel width structures correctly. It is important to note that while the parameters used to tune this specific TV reconstruction (available in demo number 9 in the TIGRE Toolbox), they are far from optimal and very sensitive\cite{Vee}. When choosing the exact optimal parameters for the TV reconstruction algorithms, the resultant images tend to be significantly better than the ones shown here, but the parameter space is very data dependent and large, thus to the author's knowledge, no parameter selection method has been proposed in the literature.

To illustrate the sensitivity to parameter selection, the algorithm SART-TV is run with 3 different values for the number of TV-iterations per SART iteration for the same data set used in the previous test. The results can be seen in figure \ref{fig:SARTTVparams}, where one can clearly see how small changes can have a devastating effect in the output image.   If a few more TV iterations are added to (b), the image gets a bit smoother and some detail is lost, as expected. However, if few iterations are removed from (b), the image can get completely destroyed. Note that these values are only applicable to this image with the exact amount of noise and projections. Different experiments may not show this behaviour or may be more intolerant to parameter change. This is arguably the biggest limitation for the common use of TV algorithms in real applications. As an advantageous point, once the good parameters are found, generally the algorithm will perform similarly for similar images, thus application specific parameters may be an option.

\section{Iterative algorithms in different CT applications}
This section tries to illustrate the effect of different algorithms within the TIGRE Toolbox for a series of datasets. 
\subsection{Medical head CBCT from  The Christie Hospital}
\subsection{Cryo soft X-ray tomography at the Diamond Light Source}

Cryo soft X-ray tomography (Cryo-SXT) is a relatively new\cite{carzaniga2014cryo} technology to image micron size biological samples in full 3D. Generally, cell-imaging is performed with electron microscopy (EM) and all its variants (transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, cryo-electron microscopy, electron tomography, etcetera), however these techniques have very limited penetration (less than 1$\mu$m) and thus often require slicing of the samples for volumetric imaging. Cryo-SXT uses the so called water window for X-ray energies around the 500eV energy range. Unlike at higher energies, where everything is invisible, water becomes transparent but carbon-based tissues are clearly visible in that range. Thus, while with lower resolution than most EM, Cryo-SXT allows full volumetric visualization of the cells without damaging the samples. In order to be able to image with an extremely accurate setup in both sample handling and X-ray parameters, these Cryo-SXT images are captured in synchrotron facilities. The data used in this work is from the B24 beam-line at the Diamond Light Source.

However, Cryo-SXT data has several sources of errors that make its reconstructed images significantly noisy. The typical penetration depth of soft X-rays is around 10$\mu$m, while the samples are generally an order of magnitude bigger than that in height and width. Thus Cryo-SXT is a limited angle problem, where most of the datasets are sampled over a 120 degree arc. In the extrema of this range, the images in the detector tend to have little or no information for some parts of the sample due to photons not reaching the detector. Additionally, the low intensity and small sample size do mean that the detector data are very noisy, as photons spread out more (at the scale of the pixel dimension) and fewer photons reach the detector. The size of the sample also comes with errors in the mechanical systems of the imaging set up. When working on a scale of microns, any small vibration is visible and considerably perturbs the measured data. Generally these types of errors are removed by pre-processing using alignment techniques, but the algorithms involved are often not fault proof and the data used in reconstruction ends up having some misalignment errors. Figure \ref{fig:Cryo-SXT} shows two of the sinograms of the datasets, where the noisy nature of the data can be intermediately appreciated. In the top figure, attenuation artefacts are visible. In the bottom figure, one can see the darkening of the areas at high angles (upper and lower parts of the figure, at 25\% of distance from the left) and areas that have been filled by the alignment algorithm with a single value (mid-left edge and bottom right edge). These last errors do have no influence in filtered backprojection (FBP), as the high-pass filtering of the data sets their values to zero, but they are a source of artefacts in iterative algorithms. Both sinograms show a considerably high amount of random noise.

The bottom figure shows strong attenuation at high angles and artefacts generated by alignment. } 
\end{figure}




A few datasets have been reconstructed from this imaging modality using various algorithms. Objective evaluation of the quality of the reconstructed image with each algorithm is not possible as, due to the noisy nature of the images, classifying some of the visual artefacts as data or noise is hard. Thus this section does not intend to claim that any of the algorithms perform better than FBP, just highlight the differences.

\subsubsection{The ``2017\_0207\_Trypanosoma\_33'' dataset.} This dataset contains a section of an image containing a few Trypanosoma, a unicellular parasitic protozoa that cause different illnesses, such as the sleeping sickness. In the images, the big blob within each of them of similar attenuation level as the rest of the cell is the nucleus, while the smaller circular features are organelles of the cell.

 Several algorithms have been used to test the effect of iterative algorithms.
Initially SIRT and CGLS have been chosen. Both of these algorithms are expected to generate images with very little noise, but perhaps lose the most detailed information, or at least create smoother boundaries than FBP, as they minimize the L2 norm using all data in one go (per iteration). The result of these, compared to FBP can be seen in figure \ref{fig:CGLSSIRT}. SIRT generates a very smooth image without barely any noise, however the details are very smoothed also, specially the boundaries of the objects. However, very few iterations of SIRT have been performed in this dataset. CGLS however seems to separate data from noise better, while also creating some smooth (not as much as SIRT) boundaries. However it is unclear how much of this is caused by misalignments within the data and how much by the algorithms themselves.

As shown earlier in this chapter, OS-SART can improve the convergence speed of SIRT sacrificing some computational time. SART may improve further the convergence, but it becomes a very computational expensive algorithm at this image sizes. Additionally, total variation minimization can be applied to remove the noise that the images have. Figure \ref{fig:OS} shows FBP, OS-SART, and ASD-POCS with 20 total variation iterations and using OS-SART instead of SART as data fidelity update (OS-ASD-POCS).

Note that the images have a darker vertical ``band'', not as obvious in SIRT and CGLS. This is caused by some errors in the projections that with a proper preprocessing step could be removed. OS-SART reconstructs a similar result to FBP, with slightly lower noise levels and extreme values. Fewer iterations of OS-SART would probably generate a less noisy image, however they will also likely show less contrast and features (similar to SIRT before). The total variation version of OS-SART generates a cleaner image, but it has a slight ``watercolour'' texture. The strength of the total variation can be controlled by the number of iterations, increasing them enhances this effect. Figure \ref{fig:OStv} shows 0, 20 and 5 TV iterations. While the tuning of this value can not (yet) be done automatically, once the desired one is found it generally works for all similar images. The actual range of values of the reconstructed voxels is different in each algorithm. This can be explained by the nature of the data, as for example, half of the values are negative, which makes no sense physically. Thus, the visualization range has been adjusted to match histograms of attenuation vale in the figures.

\subsubsection{The ``3\_20160218\_tomo\_65t55\_p5\_area\_2MB1\_Export'' dataset.} This dataset contains, as described by Luengo \textit{et al}\cite{LUENGO201743} the zoomed area of a ``neuronal-like mammalian cell line (PC-12\cite{apostol2003cell}).'' The article has more information on the preparation of the samples.

 The big smooth area in the top left side is the nucleus of the cell, while the rest are organelles on the cytoplasm of the cell.  In figure \ref{fig:Diamond2} the reconstructed image can be seen, on where the columns show FBP, OS-SART, CGLS and OS-ASD-POCS algorithms, and the rows different zoomed areas of the image. Due to hinger noise in the projections, the iterative algorithms to have a strong influence in the removal of the noise in this dataset. This is clearly apparent in the second row of the figure \ref{fig:Diamond2}, on where the three iterative algorithms, specially the TV based one, remove significantly the noise of the organelles both in the left and right side of the image. 

\subsubsection{The ``Grid1\_Area2\_Cell2\_tomo3-All\_60t60\_p5d\_6s\_mb1\_Export'' dataset}
