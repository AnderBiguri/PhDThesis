\chapter{Numerical Study of Motion Compensation}


In the previous chapter of this thesis a motion compensation algorithm is proposed as a general algorithm, and then is specifically focused for IGRT. The method however is scarcely compared with standard IGRT 4D CBCT image reconstruction methods, and some questions about the reliability of the motion models arise. Obtaining accurate motion description of the patients is still one of the biggest challenges in 4D imaging, regardless of the method used. How accurate do this models need to be? Additionally, if the motion is previously known to high accuracy, is 4D imaging necessary at all? 

This chapter looks more specifically at these challenges and compares the motion compensated reconstruction to
