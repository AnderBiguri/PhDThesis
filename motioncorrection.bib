  abstract={Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) has been clinically used to verify patient position and to localize the target of treatment in image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT). However, when the chest and the upper abdomen are scanned, respiratory-induced motion blurring limits the utility of CBCT. In order to mitigate this blurring, respiratory-gated CBCT, i.e. 4D CBCT, was introduced. In 4D CBCT, the cone-beam projection data sets acquired during a gantry rotation are sorted into several respiratory phases. In these gated reconstructions, the number of projections for each respiratory phase is significantly reduced. Consequently, undersampling streaking artifacts are present in the reconstructed images, and the image contrast resolution is also significantly compromised. In this paper, we present a new method to simultaneously achieve both high temporal resolution (~100 ms) and streaking artifact-free image volumes in 4D CBCT. The enabling technique is a newly proposed image reconstruction method, i.e. prior image constrained compressed sensing (PICCS), which enables accurate image reconstruction using vastly undersampled cone-beam projections and a fully sampled prior image. Using PICCS, a streak-free image can be reconstructed from 10?20 cone-beam projections while the signal-to-noise ratio is determined by a denoising feature of the selected objective function and by the prior image, which is reconstructed using all of the acquired cone-beam projections. This feature of PICCS breaks the connection between the temporal resolution and streaking artifacts' level in 4D CBCT. Numerical simulations and experimental phantom studies have been conducted to validate the method.}

  abstract={4D cone-beam computed tomography (4DCBCT) reconstructs a temporal sequence of CBCT images for the purpose of motion management or 4D treatment in radiotherapy. However the image reconstruction often involves the binning of projection data to each temporal phase, and therefore suffers from deteriorated image quality due to inaccurate or uneven binning in phase, e.g., under the non-periodic breathing. A 5D model has been developed as an accurate model of (periodic and non-periodic) respiratory motion. That is, given the measurements of breathing amplitude and its time derivative, the 5D model parametrizes the respiratory motion by three time-independent variables, i.e., one reference image and two vector fields. In this work we aim to develop a new 4DCBCT reconstruction method based on 5D model. Instead of reconstructing a temporal sequence of images after the projection binning, the new method reconstructs time-independent reference image and vector fields with no requirement of binning. The image reconstruction is formulated as a optimization problem with total-variation regularization on both reference image and vector fields, and the problem is solved by the proximal alternating minimization algorithm, during which the split Bregman method is used to reconstruct the reference image, and the Chambolle's duality-based algorithm is used to reconstruct the vector fields. The convergence analysis of the proposed algorithm is provided for this nonconvex problem. Validated by the simulation studies, the new method has significantly improved image reconstruction accuracy due to no binning and reduced number of unknowns via the use of the 5D model.}

  abstract={The purpose of this paper for four-dimensional (4D) computed tomography (CT) is threefold. (1) A new spatiotemporal model is presented from the matrix perspective with the row dimension in space and the column dimension in time, namely the robust PCA (principal component analysis)-based 4D CT model. That is, instead of viewing the 4D object as a temporal collection of three-dimensional (3D) images and looking for local coherence in time or space independently, we perceive it as a mixture of low-rank matrix and sparse matrix to explore the maximum temporal coherence of the spatial structure among phases. Here the low-rank matrix corresponds to the 'background' or reference state, which is stationary over time or similar in structure; the sparse matrix stands for the 'motion' or time-varying component, e.g., heart motion in cardiac imaging, which is often either approximately sparse itself or can be sparsified in the proper basis. Besides 4D CT, this robust PCA-based 4D CT model should be applicable in other imaging problems for motion reduction or/and change detection with the least amount of data, such as multi-energy CT, cardiac MRI, and hyperspectral imaging. (2) A dynamic strategy for data acquisition, i.e. a temporally spiral scheme, is proposed that can potentially maintain similar reconstruction accuracy with far fewer projections of the data. The key point of this dynamic scheme is to reduce the total number of measurements, and hence the radiation dose, by acquiring complementary data in different phases while reducing redundant measurements of the common background structure. (3) An accurate, efficient, yet simple-to-implement algorithm based on the split Bregman method is developed for solving the model problem with sparse representation in tight frames.}

  abstract={Temporal-correlated image reconstruction, also known as 4D CT image reconstruction, is a big challenge in computed tomography. The reasons for incorporating the temporal domain into the reconstruction are motions of the scanned object, which would otherwise lead to motion artifacts. The standard method for 4D CT image reconstruction is extracting single motion phases and reconstructing them separately. These reconstructions can suffer from undersampling artifacts due to the low number of used projections in each phase. There are different iterative methods which try to incorporate some a priori knowledge to compensate for these artifacts. In this paper we want to follow this strategy. The cost function we use is a higher dimensional cost function which accounts for the sparseness of the measured signal in the spatial and temporal directions. This leads to the definition of a higher dimensional total variation. The method is validated using in vivo cardiac micro-CT mouse data. Additionally, we compare the results to phase-correlated reconstructions using the FDK algorithm and a total variation constrained reconstruction, where the total variation term is only defined in the spatial domain. The reconstructed datasets show strong improvements in terms of artifact reduction and low-contrast resolution compared to other methods. Thereby the temporal resolution of the reconstructed signal is not affected.}

  abstract={A simultaneous motion estimation and image reconstruction (SMEIR) strategy was proposed for 4D cone-beam CT (4D-CBCT) reconstruction and showed excellent results in both phantom and lung cancer patient studies. In the original SMEIR algorithm, the deformation vector field (DVF) was defined on voxel grid and estimated by enforcing a global smoothness regularization term on the motion fields. The objective of this work is to improve the computation efficiency and motion estimation accuracy of SMEIR for 4D-CBCT through developing a multi-organ meshing model. Feature-based adaptive meshes were generated to reduce the number of unknowns in the DVF estimation and accurately capture the organ shapes and motion. Additionally, the discontinuity in the motion fields between different organs during respiration was explicitly considered in the multi-organ mesh model. This will help with the accurate visualization and motion estimation of the tumor on the organ boundaries in 4D-CBCT. To further improve the computational efficiency, a GPU-based parallel implementation was designed. The performance of the proposed algorithm was evaluated on a synthetic sliding motion phantom, a 4D NCAT phantom, and four lung cancer patients. The proposed multi-organ mesh based strategy outperformed the conventional Feldkamp�Davis�Kress, iterative total variation minimization, original SMEIR and single meshing method based on both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.}

  abstract={Despite major advances in x-ray sources, detector arrays, gantry mechanical design and especially computer performance, one component of computed tomography (CT) scanners has remained virtually constant for the past 25 years�the reconstruction algorithm. Fundamental advances have been made in the solution of inverse problems, especially tomographic reconstruction, but these works have not been translated into clinical and related practice. The reasons are not obvious and seldom discussed. This review seeks to examine the reasons for this discrepancy and provides recommendations on how it can be resolved. We take the example of field of compressive sensing (CS), summarizing this new area of research from the eyes of practical medical physicists and explaining the disconnection between theoretical and application-oriented research. Using a few issues specific to CT, which engineers have addressed in very specific ways, we try to distill the mathematical problem underlying each of these issues with the hope of demonstrating that there are interesting mathematical problems of general importance that can result from in depth analysis of specific issues. We then sketch some unconventional CT-imaging designs that have the potential to impact on CT applications, if the link between applied mathematicians and engineers/physicists were stronger. Finally, we close with some observations on how the link could be strengthened. There is, we believe, an important opportunity to rapidly improve the performance of CT and related tomographic imaging techniques by addressing these issues.}

They were successfully used in the early years of CT, but given up when the amount of measured data increased because of the higher computational demands of \{IR\} compared to analytical methods. The availability of large computational capacities in normal workstations and the ongoing efforts towards lower doses in \{CT\} have changed the situation; \{IR\} has become a hot topic for all major vendors of clinical \{CT\} systems in the past 5 years. This review strives to provide information on \{IR\} methods and aims at interested physicists and physicians already active in the field of CT. We give an overview on the terminology used and an introduction to the most important algorithmic concepts including references for further reading. As a practical example, details on a model-based iterative reconstruction algorithm implemented on a modern graphics adapter (GPU) are presented, followed by application examples for several dedicated \{CT\} scanners in order to demonstrate the performance and potential of iterative reconstruction methods. Finally, some general thoughts regarding the advantages and disadvantages of \{IR\} methods as well as open points for research in this field are discussed. "

  abstract={In this article the Tomographic Iterative GPU-based Reconstruction (TIGRE) Toolbox, a MATLAB/CUDA toolbox for fast and accurate 3D x-ray image reconstruction, is presented. One of the key features is the implementation of a wide variety of iterative algorithms as well as FDK, including a range of algorithms in the SART family, the Krylov subspace family and a range of methods using total variation regularization. Additionally, the toolbox has GPU-accelerated projection and back projection using the latest techniques and it has a modular design that facilitates the implementation of new algorithms. We present an overview of the structure and techniques used in the creation of the toolbox, together with two usage examples. The TIGRE Toolbox is released under an open source licence, encouraging people to contribute.}

  abstract={An iterative algorithm, based on recent work in compressive sensing, is developed for volume image reconstruction from a circular cone-beam scan. The algorithm minimizes the total variation (TV) of the image subject to the constraint that the estimated projection data is within a specified tolerance of the available data and that the values of the volume image are non-negative. The constraints are enforced by the use of projection onto convex sets (POCS) and the TV objective is minimized by steepest descent with an adaptive step-size. The algorithm is referred to as adaptive-steepest-descent-POCS (ASD-POCS). It appears to be robust against cone-beam artifacts, and may be particularly useful when the angular range is limited or when the angular sampling rate is low. The ASD-POCS algorithm is tested with the Defrise disk and jaw computerized phantoms. Some comparisons are performed with the POCS and expectation-maximization (EM) algorithms. Although the algorithm is presented in the context of circular cone-beam image reconstruction, it can also be applied to scanning geometries involving other x-ray source trajectories.}

abstract = "Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) is widely used in radiation therapy for verifying treatment areas, since it provides three-dimensional image reconstruction of those tumour regions under inspection. However, organ motion is problematic during the scanning process, it causes motion artefacts on the \{CBCT\} image and can lead to mispositioning for the subsequent treatment. Moreover, patient dose is also considerable and there is a need for methods which yield acceptable image quality with as few X-ray images as possible. Although methods have been developed to handle limited projection data, such as the Algebraic Reconstruction Technique (ART); Simultaneous \{ART\} (SART); and Ordered-Subset \{SART\} (OS-SART), this study applied motion compensation to these reconstruction techniques. Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of image is calculated to study the convergence of reconstructed images compared with the truth image. When motion was applied to a phantom and the motion compensation was used to account for the motion, the results showed that motion compensation improved the quality of \{CBCT\} image, when compared to uncompensated images. Furthermore, the experiments suggested that minimising phase error, for breathing models, was more important than minimising amplitude error. "

abstract = "Purpose To quantify the interfractional variability in lung tumor trajectory and mean position during the course of radiation therapy. Methods and Materials Repeat four-dimensional (4D) cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans (median, nine scans/patient) routinely acquired during the course of treatment were analyzed for 56 patients with lung cancer. Tumor motion was assessed by using local rigid registration of a region of interest in the 3D planning \{CT\} to each phase in the 4D CBCT. Displacements of the mean tumor position relative to the planned position (baseline variations) were obtained by using time-weighted averaging of the motion curve. Results The tumor trajectory shape was found to be stable interfractionally, with mean variability not exceeding 1 mm (1 SD) in each direction for the inhale and exhale phases. Interfractional baseline variations, however, were large, with 1.6- (left-right), 3.9- (cranial-caudal), and 2.8-mm (anterior-posterior) systematic variations (1 SD) and 1.2- (left-right), 2.4- (cranial-caudal) and 2.2-mm (anterior-posterior) random variations. Eliminating baseline variations by using soft-tissue guidance decreases planning target volume margins by approximately 50% compared with bony anatomy–driven protocols for conventional fractionation schemes. Conclusions Systematic and random baseline variations constitute a substantial portion of the geometric variability present in the treatment of patients with lung cancer and require generous safety margins when relying on accurate setup/immobilization or bony anatomy–driven correction strategies. The 4D-CBCT has the ability to accurately monitor tumor trajectory shape and baseline variations and drive image-guided correction strategies that allows safe margin reduction. "

  abstract={Respiratory organ motion has a significant impact on the planning and delivery of radiotherapy (RT) treatment for lung cancer. Currently widespread techniques, such as 4D-computed tomography (4DCT), cannot be used to measure variability of this motion from one cycle to the next. In this paper, we describe the use of fast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques to investigate the intra- and inter-cycle reproducibility of respiratory motion and also to estimate the level of errors that may be introduced into treatment delivery by using various breath-hold imaging strategies during lung RT planning. A reference model of respiratory motion is formed to enable comparison of different breathing cycles at any arbitrary position in the respiratory cycle. This is constructed by using free-breathing images from the inhale phase of a single breathing cycle, then co-registering the images, and thereby tracking landmarks. This reference model is then compared to alternative models constructed from images acquired during the exhale phase of the same cycle and the inhale phase of a subsequent cycle, to assess intra- and inter-cycle variability ('hysteresis' and 'reproducibility') of organ motion. The reference model is also compared to a series of models formed from breath-hold data at exhale and inhale. Evaluation of these models is carried out on data from ten healthy volunteers and five lung cancer patients. Free-breathing models show good levels of intra- and inter-cycle reproducibility across the tidal breathing range. Mean intra-cycle errors in the position of organ surface landmarks of 1.5(1.4)–3.5(3.3) mm for volunteers and 2.8(1.8)–5.2(5.2) mm for patients. Equivalent measures of inter-cycle variability across this range are 1.7(1.0)–3.9(3.3) mm for volunteers and 2.8(1.8)–3.3(2.2) mm for patients. As expected, models based on breath-hold sequences do not represent normal tidal motion as well as those based on free-breathing data, with mean errors of 4.4(2.2)–7.7(3.9) mm for volunteers and 10.1(6.1)–12.5(6.3) mm for patients. Errors are generally larger still when using a single breath-hold image at either exhale or inhale to represent the lung. This indicates that account should be taken of intra- and inter-cycle respiratory motion variability and that breath-hold-based methods of obtaining data for RT planning may potentially introduce large errors. This approach to analysis of motion and variability has potential to inform decisions about treatment margins and optimize RT planning.}

  abstract={The patient respiratory signal associated with the cone beam CT (CBCT) projections is important for lung cancer radiotherapy. In contrast to monitoring an external surrogate of respiration, such a signal can be extracted directly from the CBCT projections. In this paper, we propose a novel local principal component analysis (LPCA) method to extract the respiratory signal by distinguishing the respiration motion-induced content change from the gantry rotation-induced content change in the CBCT projections. The LPCA method is evaluated by comparing with three state-of-the-art projection-based methods, namely the Amsterdam Shroud method, the intensity analysis method and the Fourier-transform-based phase analysis method. The clinical CBCT projection data of eight patients, acquired under various clinical scenarios, were used to investigate the performance of each method. We found that the proposed LPCA method has demonstrated the best overall performance for cases tested and thus is a promising technique for extracting a respiratory signal. We also identified the applicability of each existing method.}
