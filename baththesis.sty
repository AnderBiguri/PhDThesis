%% Page layout: the regs ask for a margin of at least 40mm on the
%% binding edge (left hand margin) and at least 15mm on all other
%% margins.  The following does the job
\oddsidemargin 15mm
\evensidemargin 0pt
\textwidth 5.7in
\textheight 234mm
\topmargin 0in
\headheight 0in                 % no header
\textheight 8.5in                       
\headsep \headheight
